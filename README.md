# 🌌 GAD — The Silent Diamond of the New Web

> _“Not the size of the grain defines its strength, but the invisible structure that sustains it.”_

**GAD (Grão de Areia de Diamante)** is a lightweight, modular, and auditable execution framework designed to power the next evolution of the web — what we call **WebX**.

GAD transforms each execution into a signed, traceable event. It uses scoped tokens, modular chains, and NDJSON logs to ensure transparency, governance, and trust.

---

## 💎 Why GAD?

- ✅ **Auditability**: Every action is logged with trace_id, latency, and metadata  
- 🔐 **Security**: Ed25519 signatures, token masking, and scoped permissions  
- ⚙️ **Modularity**: Plug-in chains for Python, AI, APIs, and external agents  
- 🌐 **Interoperability**: Designed to bridge Web2 simplicity with Web3 sovereignty

GAD is the missing link between usability and decentralization.  
It’s not Web2. It’s not Web3. It’s **WebX**.

- **Token**: Signed with origin, scope, TTL  
- **Chain**: Modular execution logic  
- **EventLog**: NDJSON output with full traceability

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Auditable AI agents  
- Verifiable APIs  
- Identity & reputation systems  
- Secure automation pipelines  
- Observability for Copilot, Azure Functions, and Logic Apps

---

## 📦 Features

- Modular executor with plug-in chains  
- Token system with scoped access and Ed25519 signatures  
- NDJSON event logging with rotation and compression  
- HTTP API for querying trace_id and summaries  
- AISand module for programmable validation and blocking

## 🧪 Getting Started

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gad
cd gad
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Or use the HTTP API:

\`\`\`http
POST /execute
Authorization: Bearer <signed-token>
Body: {
  "chain": "python:detect",
  "input": { ... }
}
\`\`\`
